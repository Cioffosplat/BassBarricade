This is a small school project of a little Tower defence style game, 
very similar to one of the most famous games in the Tower Defence world: Plants Vs Zombies.
This project will be constantly be updated and polished with whatever 
I can possibly develop with my skillset.

The game works on a browser and is saved in GitHub Pages, but without leaderboard interaction 
caused by no BackEnd implementation (this is a FrontEnd project with the use of JSON). 
Game Link: https://cioffosplat.github.io/BassBarricade/index.html

To make the software work correctly with the leaderboard:
- If you don't have node, install it at https://nodejs.org/en/download
- Run the nodeInstallJsonServer
- After run the jsonServer.bat file
- Lastly open the index.html page on any Web-Browser of preference
